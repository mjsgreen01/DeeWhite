								Started from the bottom, now he's here. Dee White has lived the life your favorite rappers rap about with no record deal. The Pennsylvania born MC's story has taken him from the city of brotherly love to the streets of the DMV, hustling his way through the obstacles of urban life to the comforts of his balcony view overlooking the city. Leaving college at the age of 19 to pursue music quickly turned to the streets where he fell victim to a friend turned informant and landed himself in prison. The moment of clarity brought on by his incarceration turned out to be a blessing in disguise as he emerged from the penitentiary with a new lease on life and a focus to make his mark on the world. <br><br>

								On the verge of dropping his debut album, "Seven" Dee White feels like the stars have aligned. The streets know his name, the city is behind him and the world wants to hear his story. They want a peek behind the curtain of the man known for making the world famous Stadium night club rain hundred dollar bills, popping bottles in every club from DC to Miami. With features from Trey Songz, Mobb Deep and Fat Trel, Dee White is poised to be a household name. His life has been a movie... now get ready for the soundtrack.
